### the Lab for Data Intensive Biology

<p class="message">
tl;dr? data good, data analysis better.
</p>

The DIB Lab tackles questions surrounding biological data analysis,
data integration, and data sharing.  Our primary interest is in
genomic, transcriptomic, and metagenomic sequence analysis.

In brief,

* the lab is the primary developer of the [khmer software](https://github.com/ged-lab/khmer/), 
  for faster and more
  efficient sequence analysis of high-throughput sequencing data.

* we run quite a bit of [training in data-intensive biology](http://dib-training.readthedocs.org/en/pub/).

* the lab is located at the [University of California, Davis](http://ucdavis.edu) 
  in the [School of Veterinary Medicine](http://www.vetmed.ucdavis.edu).

The lab is run by **Dr. C. Titus Brown**, an Associate Professor at UC
Davis; you can see many of the lab's publications [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=O4rYanMAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate>). You
can read more about the lab members under [members](/members.html).
